# Mount the SMB Share mount to LXC Container of Jellyfin/Emby/Plex etc...

1. Stop the LXC container where you want to mount the smb share mount

2. Change directory to the below location and list all configurations in the directory

```
	cd /etc/pve/lxc/

	ls -al
```

3. Find the conf file for the lxc container you want to mount the smb mount, for example : 100.conf.

4. Now using a file editor like vi command, add the following command 

```
	mp0: /path/of/smbsharemount ,mp=/mountpath/in/lxc


	eg:  mp0: /media/share/Movies,mp=/media/
```
5. Now start the container, check if the LXC start properly, else there is something missing in the mounting process, mostly wrong path mention in the conf file.

6. In the console of the LXC, now check the path provided as mount point in the command above mentioned.
